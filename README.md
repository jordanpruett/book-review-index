**NOTE** 

This project is a work-in-progress. Data will not be published until after publication of the article itself. You won't actually be able to run the code yourself until it is uploaded. In the meantime, I'll keep just the in-progress notebooks, scripts, and visualizations available here for public view.

**SUMMARY**

This repo contains data and code to support replication of my dissertation chapter, "Dimensions of prestige: an Analysis of the Book Review Index, 1965-2000"

All methods used to generate the statistics and visualizations from the chapter are contained in .ipynb notebooks.

The notebooks were designed to be entirely modular, so you can run one of them without needing to run the others.

Generated statistics are shown in-line in the notebook itself. 

Generated visualizations are show in-line and are also saved in the corresponding folder in "images." 

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1) install dependencies in requirements.txt

2) run data_prep.py from the main directory, which will preprocess the raw OCR data and create the two .tsv files used in the notebooks

3) ready to go! fire up a notebook of your choice and see what treasures lie within
