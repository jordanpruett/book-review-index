    "In the previous notebook, we saw that assessing the similarity of authors according to their \"review profile\" yielded remarkably intuitive groupings. In particular, this method was picking up on more than just the co-presence of 1 or 2 journals in two authors' review sets. Anne Rice, for example, was grouped with other mystery and suspense authors *even though* her top journals were not explicitly dedicated to that genre. What this means is that there is some particular combination of journals that is associated with \"detectiveness,\" at least in this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will attempt to recover some of the most prominent of these underlying combinations that account for the structure of the data. We'll be using a method known as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), which decomposes a matrix into two lower-rank matrices that approximate its structure. NMF is used in many applications, such as recommendation systems and topic modeling. "
